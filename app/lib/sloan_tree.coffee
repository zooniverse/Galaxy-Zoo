If you can see any interesting features at all, click &quot;features or disk.&quot; Just occasionally you might see something that isn't a galaxy at all - the long streak of a satellite, for example, or an image swamped by light from a bright star. If this happens, just click &quot;star or artifact&quot;. Click to see larger images."
