    @help "The aim here is to divide featureless galaxies from all the rest. If you can see any interesting features at all, click &quot;features or disk.&quot; Just occasionally you might see something that isn't a galaxy at all - the long streak of a satellite, for example, or an image swamped by light from a bright star.
