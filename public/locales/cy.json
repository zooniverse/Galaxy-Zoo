    "morphology": {
      "heading": "Why is galaxy morphology important?",
      "body": "To first order, the morphology of a galaxy is a tracer of the orbital dynamics of the stars in it, but it also carries an imprint of the processes driving star formation and nuclear activity in galaxies. Visual morphology produces classifications which are strongly correlated with other, physical parameters. To give a single example, the presence of multiple nuclei and extended tidal features indicates that the dominant mechanism driving star formation is an ongoing merger. Equally, the absence of such features implies that the evolution of the galaxy may be being driven by slower ('secular') processes.",
      "reference": "Traditionally morphology has been derived either by visual inspection of galaxy images (e.g. <a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1926ApJ....64..321H\" target=\"_blank\">Hubble 1926</a>, <a href=\"http://heasarc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/rc3.html\" target=\"_blank\">de Vaucouleurs 1991</a>, and more recently e.g. <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.2401\" target=\"_blank\">Nair and Abraham 2010</a>) or via morphological parameters, such as Concentration, Asymmetry, Clumpiness, M20, the Gini coefficient, etc (e.g. <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0303065\" target=\"_blank\">Conselice 2003</a>, <a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008ApJ...672..177L\" target=\"_blank\">Lotz et al. 2008</a>). Strictly speaking, these parameters are morphological 'proxies', each with its own attendant biases, which are typically checked and calibrated against visual inspection. A visual approach is generally more resistant to changing signal-to-noise and resolution in images (e.g. <a href=\"http://labs.adsabs.harvard.edu/adsabs/abs/2008ApJS..179..319L\">Lisker 2008</a>), making it an ideal method for determining galaxy morphology. Nevertheless, morphological parameters have been valuable for classifying large survey-scale datasets, for which visual inspection by individuals (or small groups of researchers) can be prohibitively time-consuming."

Using more than half a million members of the general public, the project has classified – via direct visual inspection - the entire Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectroscopic sample and all existing Hubble Space Telescope surveys (around 1.5 million galaxies in total). With more than 40 classifications per object, Galaxy Zoo provides both a visual classification and an associated uncertainty (which is challenging to estimate if there are only a few human classifiers). The classifications themselves have been demonstrated to be of comparable accuracy to those derived by expert astronomers (see Lintott et al. 2008)."

One of the unique aspects of Galaxy Zoo over automated morphological measurements is the possibility of serendipitous discoveries (often aided by volunteer led discussion on the <a href=\"http://www.galaxyzooforum.org\">Galaxy Zoo Forum</a>). These have included the discovery of 'green peas' (a class of compact extremely star-forming galaxies in the local Universe; <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/0907.4155\">Cardamone et al. 2009</a>) and perhaps most famously \"Hanny's Voorwerp\" (<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/0906.5304\">Lintott et al. 2009</a>) along with a survey of similar AGN-ionised gas clouds (<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.6921\">Keel et al. 2012</a>). The availability of a large sample of galaxies with both color and morphological information has led to the important realisation that color, not morphology, is most strongly correlated with environment (<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/0805.2612\">Bamford et al. 2009</a>; <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/0811.3970\">Skibba et al. 2009</a>), leading to intriguing subclasses of galaxies like red spiral galaxies (<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.4113\">Masters et al. 2010</a>) and blue ellipticals (<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/0903.3415\">Schawinski et al. 2009</a>)."

The SDSS images are from DR8 and the Southern Galactic cap, which increases the sample size of galaxies in the local universe by 40%. The HST images are from CANDELS, the largest HST Treasury Program. This survey is designed to take advantage of the advent of Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3), which is rapidly opening up a new window into galaxies at z > 1 – the first 50% of the lifetime of the Universe. Previous HST imaging at these epochs largely sampled the rest-frame ultraviolet, since the available survey instruments (e.g. ACS) operated in the optical wavelengths. However, the near-infrared capabilities of the WFC3 (a factor of 20 better than NICMOS) are providing us with unprecedented rest-frame optical data of galaxies at z > 1.",
      "candels": "CANDELS is using the WFC3 near-infrared filters to image 800 arcmin<sup>2</sup> in established HST legacy fields (e.g. GOODS, COSMOS). The near-infrared WFC3 images are particularly important because morphological analysis is best performed in rest-frame optical wavelengths, which trace the underlying stellar population of the galaxy rather than just the UV-bright star-forming regions.",
      "combination": "The combination of the SDSS and CANDELS Galaxy Zoo samples will offer a formidable tool for answering significant open questions that demand a morphological analysis. For example, at what epochs was the Hubble sequence established? How and when were the primordial spheroids formed? What was the relative role of major mergers and secular processes in driving star formation and black hole growth in the early Universe?",
      "ukidss": "The UKIRT images are from the Large Area Survey (LAS) as part of UKIDSS, which imaged 4000 sq. deg. of the sky overlapping with the SDSS fields. We selected all galaxies classified in Galaxy Zoo 2 that had high-quality UKIDSS imaging, totaling about 70,000 galaxies. The images shown on the site are a colour-composite of the Y, J, and K-band images (where the J-band uses dithered observations to improve the angular resolution in that channel). These images will allow us to trace morphology as a function of wavelength; for example, whether the observed bar fraction increases for galaxies in the rest-frame infrared.",
      "ferengi": "Finally, Galaxy Zoo also includes a small set of SDSS images that have been artificially processed to simulate the observed effects of redshift. This set used a morphologically diverse sample of galaxies from Galaxy Zoo 2 and were processed using the FERENGI code (<a href=\"http://www.mpia-hd.mpg.de/FERENGI/\">Barden, Jahnke, & Hausler 2008</a>) out to redshifts of z=1. Results from these images will be used as calibration for galaxies in the GZ: Hubble and CANDELS data, since it allows us to assess resolution and brightness-dependent biases independent of true galaxy evolution.",
      "conclusion": "The purpose of the Galaxy Zoo project is to answer such questions, prepare the ground for morphological work using future instruments like the JWST and produce samples of morphologically selected high-redshift galaxies for follow-up using instruments like the extremely large telescopes and ALMA."

Many are remarkably beautiful, and the aim of Galaxy Zoo is to study them, assisting astronomers in attempting to understand how the galaxies we see around us formed, and what their stories can tell us about the past, present and future of our Universe as a whole.",
    "p2": "Our strategy is based on the remarkable fact that you can tell a lot about a galaxy just from its shape. Find a system with spiral arms, for example, and normally - but critically not always - you'll know that you're looking at a rotating disk of stars, dust and gas with plenty of fuel for future star formation. Find one of the big balls of stars we call ellipticals, however, and you're probably looking at a more mature system, one which long ago finished forming stars. The galaxies' histories are also revealed; that elliptical is likely to be the product of a head-on collision between two smaller galaxies, and smaller scars such as warped disks, large bulges or long streams of stars bear testament to the complexity of these galaxies' lives.",
    "p3": "We've already said that a merger can have a major impact on a galaxy’s appearance, but many other factors could have played an important role; for example, there is steadily growing evidence (not least from previous Galaxy Zoo projects) that the black holes that lurk at the heart of galaxies may have a profound effect on their surroundings.",
    "p4": "As material falls towards the black hole, it can be heated to enormous temperatures and the resulting radiation packs a powerful punch, sometimes aided by the presence of powerful jets of materials flung away from the vicinity of the black hole (though not, of course, from the black hole itself) at close to the speed of light. These combination of forces can, it seems, heat or expel gas from the galaxy, depriving it of fuel for future star formation and changing its face for ever.",
    "p5": "A galaxy's surroundings matter too. At the centre of the Virgo cluster, our nearest large group of galaxies, mergers between systems are rare - held by the cluster’s powerful gravitational grip, galaxies are moving too fast for more than brief encounters. In the emptiest parts of space, the density of galaxies is just too low for mergers to play a significant role, and so it’s only on the outskirts of clusters or in small groups like our own Local Group that mergers currently play a significant part. It should come as no surprise, then, that we find different types of galaxies in different places, and this too must be taken into account.",
    "p6": "Disentangling these effects, and many more, requires the largest possible samples of classified galaxies. It’s not uncommon for us to need, for example, a large sample of red, barred, spiral galaxies that reside on the edges of clusters, and if we don't have a large sample to begin with there will be none left when we've narrowed the search. Modern surveys provide enough images - hundreds of thousands upon hundreds of thousands of them - but we still need people to classify them. That's where you come in...",
    "subtitle": "Where do the images come from?",
    "p7": "The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) started in 2000 and is one of the first, and largest, digital maps of the Universe available to astronomers. The original SDSS, which ran for 5 years, included two main instruments, namely a 126 megapixel imaging camera and two fiber-fed spectrographs, mounted on a dedicated 2.5 meter telescope at Apache Point Observatory in New Mexico. During good weather, the SDSS undertook draft-scan imaging of the northern sky using the camera, while in cloud conditions the SDSS obtained spectra of a sub-set of detected objects to measure their redshift and thus distance. From 2005 to 2008, the second phase of SDSS, or SDSS-II, continued to survey the north galactic cap of our Galaxy as well as undertaking a new supernova survey and a new spectroscopic survey of stars (SEGUE). Since 2008, the third incarnation of the SDSS, or SDSS-III, has focused exclusively on spectroscopy (the imaging camera has been retired to the Smithsonian Museum) and comprises of four sub-surveys of BOSS, APOGEE, SEGUE and MARVELS.",
    "p8": "The scientific legacy of the SDSS is amazing, partly due to the annual release of SDSS data to the astronomical community and public. For example, in 2011, the SDSS collaboration published its eighth data release (DR8), which contains 14,555 square degrees of optical imaging data (with over a trillion pixels), and contains 932 million unique objects, of which 1.63 million objects possessed a SDSS spectrum. This awesome astronomical resource is freely available via a state-of-the-art database. Astronomers have written over 4000 papers (approximate one a day) using SDSS public data, gaining over 175,000 citations. Within the SDSS collaboration, there have been more than 120 PhD theses, while the SDSS data fueling numerous high impact outreach projects e.g. Galaxy Zoo. The SDSS has been named several times the highest impact project, facility or mission in the field of astronomy (Madrid & Macchetto 2006, 2009), and is the source of the most highly cited astronomy article in the years 2000, 2002, 2005, and 2008 (Frogel et al. 2010).",
    "p9": "The SDSS would not have been possible without a large collaboration of scientists, researchers and astronomers. Many of the astronomers involved in the original SDSS have now moved on in their careers, spreading their experience within large collaborations across the world. At the start of the SDSS, such large collaborations in astronomy were rare and the SDSS has also been at the forefront of changing the culture of collaborative research in astrophysics. The SDSS is now planning a new 4th phase starting 2014. This phase will involve a number of targeted surveys including eBOSS, MaNGA and APOGEE-S2, which are designed to simultaneously explore the distant universe, the dynamics of nearby galaxies, and study stars in our own Galaxy. By the end of this 4th phase, the SDSS will have provided excellent data for over two decades, resulting in over 5 million astronomical spectra.",
    "p10": "As we peer deeper into the universe, we look into the past, and since the universe is expanding, the galaxies we see are moving away from us faster and faster. This means that the light that left them gets stretched by the time it reaches us. Thus, the light from stars gets \"redshifted\" and to get a visible light image of a galaxy in the early universe, we need an infrared camera. Taking infrared images is much harder than optical ones for many reasons, but the most important one is that the night sky actually glows in the infrared. This fundamentally limits our ability to take deep infrared images, which is why Hubble's new Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) with its infrared capability is so valuable.",
    "p11": "A new generation of surveys using the WFC3 is giving us an unprecedented view into the first third of the lifetime of the Universe: the first 3-4 billion years after the Big Bang. Foremost among these is the Cosmic Assembly Deep Extragalactic Near-infrared Survey (CANDELS). The largest treasury survey using the Hubble Space Telescope to date, CANDELS is surveying several patches of sky to put together the largest collection of deep infrared images of galaxies in the early Universe. The combination of Galaxy Zoo and CANDELS offers a formidable tool in our quest to understand the earliest stages of the evolution of the visible Universe, one of the fundamental questions in observational cosmology today.",
    "p12": "While astronomers have learned an amazing amount from the SDSS and Hubble images, there are also areas we can only probe if we look at galaxies in wavelengths beyond those seen by the human eye. For objects that radiate thermally (such as stars), the wavelength used probes the temperature of the object being observed. Stars like our own Sun have temperatures around 5500 K, which show up strongly in the optical wavelengths used in SDSS imaging. If we look at galaxies in ultraviolet wavelengths, however, hotter regions become more prominent; in galaxies, this means we're picking out young, massive stars and individual star-forming regions (often leading to a patchier appearance). For galaxies observed at infrared wavelengths, cooler regions become more prominent; these include older and lower-mass stars, as well as clouds of dust that are heated by the stars and then re-emit that light at lower energies.",
    "p13": "Comparing the morphologies of galaxies at multiple wavelengths gives astronomers a much more complete picture of the processes that govern their astrophysics. Tracing stars by temperature gives us proxies for their age and chemical evolution, while identifying star formation regions tells us where the densest parts of the disk are and where the mass in these galaxies is being built up.",
    "p14": "The new infrared images on Galaxy Zoo come from the United Kingdom Infared Survey Telescope (UKIRT), a 3.8m telescope located on the summit of Mauna Kea in Hawaii at nearly 14,000 ft. elevation. Starting in 2005, UKIRT began an infrared survey of the northern sky called UKIDSS, covering 7500 square degrees at wavelengths of 1--2.5 microns. A portion of this survey was dedicated to covering the same regions as the SDSS. This means that the new UKIDSS images in Galaxy Zoo have already been classified by users in Galaxy Zoo 2; this will let us do direct comparisons for the two samples and examine how morphology (like the fraction of galaxies with bars, for example) changes with the wavelength being used."

  "story": {
    "title": "The Story So Far",
    "p1": "The launch of this new version of Galaxy Zoo, the 4th, comes just a few weeks after the site's 5th birthday. It all started back in July 2007, with a data set made up of a million galaxies imaged by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, who still provide some of the images in the site today. With so many galaxies, we'd assumed it would take years for visitors to the site to work through them all, but within 24 hours of launch we were stunned to be receiving almost 70,000 classifications an hour. In the end, more than 50 million classifications were received by the project during its first year, contributed by more than 150,000 people.",
    "p2": "That meant that each galaxy was seen by many different participants. This is deliberate; having multiple independent classifications of the same object is important, as it allows us to assess how reliable our results are. For example, for projects where we may only need a few thousand galaxies but want to be sure they're all spirals before using up valuable telescope time on them, there's no problem - we can just use those that 100% of classifiers agree are spiral. For other projects, we may need to look at the properties of hundreds of thousands of galaxies, and can use those that a majority say are spiral.",
    "p3": "The task in that first Galaxy Zoo was slightly simpler than yours; all we asked volunteers to do was to split the galaxies into ellipticals, mergers and spirals and - if the galaxy was spiral - to record the direction of the arms. But it was enough to show that the classifications Galaxy Zoo provides were as good as those from professional astronomers, and were of use to a large number of researchers. You can find out what people have been up to with Galaxy Zoo data in our list of <a href=\"#/papers\" data-nav=\"/papers\">papers published</a> and on the <a href=\"http://blog.galaxyzoo.org\" target=\"_blank\">Galaxy Zoo blog</a>, as well as below. Perhaps the most exciting sign of success is the fact that we’ve been successful in bidding for time on some of the largest telescopes in the world to follow up on many Galaxy Zoo discoveries : the list currently includes the Isaac Newton and William Herschel Telescopes on the island of La Palma in the Canaries, Gemini South in Chile, the WIYN telescope on Kitt Peak, Arizona, the IRAM radio telescope in Spain's Sierra Nevada, Swift, GALEX, Chandra, XMM-Newton and Suzaku up in space, and perhaps most excitingly the Hubble Space Telescope.",
    "p4": "Galaxy Zoo 2 was inspired by our newfound confidence in the ability of you, our volunteer classifiers, and so we asked for a closer look at just over 200,000 of the brightest of the Sloan galaxies. We asked about the number of spiral arms, the size of the galaxies' bulges and much else besides. Once again, we were thrilled with the response (and a little more prepared for it than we were for Zoo 1!) and in the 14 months the site was up we received a little more than 60 million classifications.",
    "p5": "Along the way, we added more detailed images from an area of the survey known as 'Stripe 82', but it was soon time to look at the more distant Universe. The site’s third incarnation, Galaxy Zoo : Hubble drew from surveys conducted by the Hubble Space Telescope to view earlier epochs of galaxy formation. In these surveys, which involve many, many days of dedicated observing time, we can see light from galaxies which has taken billions of years to reach us. The idea behind Galaxy Zoo : Hubble was to be able to compare galaxies then to galaxies now, giving us a clear understanding of what factors influence their growth, whether through mergers, active black holes or simply star formation.",
    "p6": "The present day Galaxy Zoo combines new imaging from Sloan, giving us our best ever view of the local Universe, with the most distant images yet from Hubble's CANDELS survey. The <a href=\"http://candels.ucolick.org\" target=\"_blank\">CANDELS survey</a> makes use of the new Wide Field Camera 3 - installed during the final shuttle mission to Hubble - to take ultra-deep images of the Universe, so who knows what's out there to be found?",
    "p7": "The site also includes images taken with the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope (UKIRT), in Hawaii, for the recently-completed UKIDSS project (http://www.ukidss.org). UKIDSS is the largest, deepest survey of the sky at infrared wavelengths. The UKIDSS infrared-light pictures and the SDSS visible-light pictures are different for two reasons. Firstly, older stars are brighter in infrared wavelengths (while in visible-light we see younger stars), and secondly, infrared light, like a foglight, can penetrate the dust and smoke in the centres of galaxies. Examining the UKIDSS images in Galaxy Zoo will therefore enable us to see how old and young stars are arranged differently in the galaxies, and will reveal more of the structure in the inner parts of galaxies."
